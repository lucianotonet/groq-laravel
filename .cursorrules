# Groq Laravel Project Rules

## Project Info
- Package: Laravel integration for GroqCloud API
- Uses PHP 8.1+ / Laravel support
- Composer package: lucianotonet/groq-laravel
- Base dependency: lucianotonet/groq-php

## Key Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use English for all code and comments
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Properly document all public methods with PHPDoc

### Models
- Default model: 'llama-3.1-8b-instant' (standardized throughout the codebase)
- Model name should be consistent in config and code

### Configuration
- Config priorities: 
  1. Runtime options (setConfig/setOptions)
  2. Environment variables (.env)
  3. Default values in config file

### Testing
- Integration tests should not rely on external resources (URLs, APIs)
- Mock API responses when possible
- Use base64 encoded test images instead of external URLs
- Tests should have descriptive names and assertions

### Error Handling
- Validate API key early with clear error messages
- Use proper exception types from GroqException

### Important Learnings
- GroqClient should preserve previously set options when calling setConfig()
- The Facade is just a proxy to the underlying client instance
- Avoid inconsistencies between default values in different parts of code
